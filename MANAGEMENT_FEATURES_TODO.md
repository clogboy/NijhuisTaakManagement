## Implementation Priority
1. **High**: Management Dashboard Page - Core functionality for managers
2. **High**: Analytics Access Control - Security and proper data scoping
3. **Medium**: Department Management Interface - Organizational structure
4. **Medium**: Team Performance Components - Individual insights
5. **Low**: Cross-Department Activity View - Advanced collaboration metrics

## Notes
- Analytics functionality is fully implemented in backend but hidden from regular users
- Management features should only be visible to users with role 'manager' or 'admin'
- All metrics are calculated in real-time from actual activity data
- Email notifications work in development mode with console logging
